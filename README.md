# Bookshelf
A css (WIP) + javascript bookshelf for personal websites.

## Demo
See the demo [here](https://jminjie.github.io/bookshelf/books.html).

## About
Display the books you've read along with your thoughts on them in a simple,
graphical showcase.

One thing that's nice about physical books is that a visitor might come to your
home and see some books you've read and enjoyed out on a shelf. This is a way
to capture that same serendipity in web form. You can probably do this with
GoodReads.
